Project Title: Splendor Hotel Groups (SHG) Booking Data Analysis

Project Overview: 

Splendor Hotel Groups (SHG) aims to enhance guest experiences and streamline operations by leveraging data-driven insights. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, my task was to thoroughly examine historical booking data from one of SHG's top resorts to identify trends, understand customer behavior, and provide actionable recommendations for strategic decision-making.

Objectives:

Booking Patterns: Analyze booking trends over time and identify peak seasons or months. Examine lead time variations across different booking channels and their correlation with customer type.

Customer Behavior Analysis: Identify the distribution channels contributing most to bookings and compare average daily rates (ADR) across these channels. Analyze guest distribution based on country of origin and its impact on revenue.

Cancellation Analysis: Determine factors strongly correlated with cancellations and predict potential cancellations. Compare revenue loss from cancellations across customer segments and distribution channels.

Revenue Optimization: Analyze overall revenue trends and identify significant revenue contributors by customer segment or country. Propose optimal pricing strategies based on ADR for different customer types and distribution channels.

Geographical Analysis: Examine guest distribution across countries and identify target countries for marketing efforts. Analyze the correlation between country of origin and likelihood of cancellations or extended stays.

Operational Efficiency: Determine average length of stay and its variation based on booking channels or customer types. Identify patterns in check-out dates to inform staffing and resource allocation.

Impact of Deposit Types: Analyze the impact of deposit types on cancellation likelihood and revenue generation. Identify patterns in deposit type usage across customer segments.

Corporate Bookings Analysis: Evaluate the proportion of corporate bookings and compare their ADR to other customer types. Identify trends related to corporate bookings to inform business strategies.

Time-to-Event Analysis: Analyze the impact of lead time on revenue and cancellation likelihood. Identify lead time ranges associated with higher customer satisfaction or revenue.

Comparison of Online and Offline Travel Agents: Compare revenue contributions from online and offline travel agents. Analyze cancellation rates and revenue variations between bookings made through online and offline agents.

Data Cleaning

Issues Identified: Blanks in Country Column: Replaced blank values with the mode (most frequent value).

Steps Taken:
Calculate the Mode: Used a PivotTable to determine the most frequent country.
Noted the mode value for use in replacing blanks. 
Replace Blanks: Utilized Excel's Find and Replace function to fill blank cells in the Country column with the mode value. 
Additional Cleaning: Addressed undefined values in the Distribution Channel column by replacing them with 'Unknown' or another appropriate category.

Data Visualization with Tableau

Dashboard Overview Created an interactive dashboard displaying essential metrics and KPIs with real-time updates and data filtering capabilities.

Visualizations Included: Seasonal Booking Patterns:

Bar chart showing monthly booking trends. Filter to view data by year.

Lead Time Analysis: Bar chart showing average lead time by booking channel. Scatter plot to analyze correlation between lead time and customer type.

Revenue and ADR Analysis: Heatmap displaying revenue by country of origin. Bar chart comparing ADR across distribution channels.

Cancellation Analysis: Pie chart showing cancellation rates by booking channel. Bar chart comparing revenue loss from cancellations by customer segment.

Geographical Analysis: Map visualization showing guest distribution by country. Analysis of countries with the highest revenue and cancellation rates.

Corporate Bookings Analysis: Bar chart comparing ADR for corporate vs. other customer types. Line chart showing trends in corporate bookings over time.

Operational Efficiency: Bar chart showing average length of stay by booking channel. Heatmap displaying check-out patterns to inform staffing.

Filters and Interactivity: Added interactive filters for Booking Date, Hotel, Distribution Channel, Customer Type, and Country. Enabled real-time updates to allow users to explore data dynamically.

Key Findings Booking Patterns: Identified peak booking months and seasons. Observed variations in lead time by booking channel, with direct bookings having the shortest lead time.

Customer Behavior: Found that online travel agents contributed the most to bookings, but with higher ADR compared to offline agents. Noted significant revenue contributions from specific countries, suggesting targeted marketing opportunities.

Cancellations: Determined that higher lead times were correlated with increased cancellation rates. Corporate bookings had lower cancellation rates but higher revenue loss when canceled.

Revenue Optimization: Recommended optimal pricing strategies based on ADR analysis. Suggested targeting specific customer segments and countries for revenue maximization. Documentation

Data Sources: Historical booking data from Splendor Hotel Groups (SHG).

Methodologies: Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel. Data visualization and analysis in Tableau.

Actionable Insights: Provided strategic recommendations based on analysis findings. Highlighted areas for operational improvements and marketing efforts.

Conclusion The comprehensive analysis of SHG's booking data has provided valuable insights into booking patterns, customer behavior, and revenue optimization. The interactive dashboard serves as a powerful tool for SHG to make data-driven decisions and enhance overall business performance.

Future Work Enhanced Predictive Analytics:

Implement machine learning models to predict cancellations and optimize pricing strategies. Continuous Data Updates:

Integrate real-time data feeds to keep the dashboard updated with the latest booking information. Expanded Scope:

Include additional resorts and properties within SHG for a more comprehensive analysis.
